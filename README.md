Im just a russian bored coder which don't know english very well but it is ok cause i at least wrote this sentence

I've never coded befor
But I started watching "Sillicon Valley" and I wanted to start coding
Coding really looks good but I think I'll have headache if I start coding
It looks hard
      end
